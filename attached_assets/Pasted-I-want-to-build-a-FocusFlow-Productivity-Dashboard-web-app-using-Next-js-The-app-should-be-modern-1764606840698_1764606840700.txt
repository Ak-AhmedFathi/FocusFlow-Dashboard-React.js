I want to build a FocusFlow – Productivity Dashboard web app using Next.js. The app should be modern, responsive, and fully functional. Please generate a detailed implementation plan including all tech stack setup, folder structure, components, pages, styling, and features. Use TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and React hooks. The app should also be optimized for performance and scalability.

Tech Stack Requirements:

Next.js (latest version, with TypeScript)

TailwindCSS for styling

React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)

Optional: React Query for state/data management

Optional: localStorage or IndexedDB for saving user data

Optional: Chart.js or Recharts for visualizing habit/task progress

Project Structure:

pages/ → Home, Dashboard, Tasks, Habits, Profile, Settings

components/ → Navbar, Sidebar, TaskCard, HabitTracker, PomodoroTimer, ProgressChart, Modal, Button

context/ → Global context for user data (tasks, habits, timer)

hooks/ → Custom hooks for tasks, habits, and Pomodoro timer

utils/ → Helper functions (date format, progress calculation, localStorage helpers)

Features:

Dashboard Overview – show daily tasks, habits, and Pomodoro progress

Tasks – add, edit, delete, mark complete, sort by priority

Habits Tracker – add habits, track daily completion, weekly/monthly charts

Pomodoro Timer – 25/5 minute timer with start/pause/reset, notifications

Dark/Light Mode – toggle theme across the app

User Data Persistence – save tasks, habits, and timer state in localStorage

Responsive Design – works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

Optional Animations – smooth transitions and hover effects

UI Guidelines:

Clean, minimalistic, modern design

Primary colors: Soft dark shades + accent color (e.g., orange or teal)

Use cards for tasks and habits, circular progress bars for Pomodoro and habit streaks

Sidebar for navigation, top Navbar with profile/settings

Deliverables Requested:

Complete Next.js project code in TypeScript

TailwindCSS configuration and responsive layout

Functional components for all features

Pomodoro timer logic with React hooks

Example task & habit data preloaded

Charts for habit and task progress

Optional: Export data as JSON file

Please provide the project step-by-step, including folder structure, example files with code snippets, and instructions to run locally. Include comments in code explaining each part for better understanding.
